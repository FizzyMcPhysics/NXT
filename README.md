NXT
===

The Lego NXT end of my project. Trying to use the NXT-Python wrapper to control the robot. 
Absolute nightmare! Code is a mess. All I want is a tacho reading expressed as an int() and I can't get it. 

I got it, but not in the best way. I can't worry about that now, I have to get on. 

forward_test5.py is the only one worth looking at here. It gets sonar and tacho reading and computes the 
velocity and acceloration of both sets of readings.
